## Overview 📖

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. Set the initial configuration and watch how it evolves! 🚀

## Features 🌟

- **Interactive Grid**: Click to bring cells to life or let them rest in peace. 💡
- **Controls**: Play, pause, reset, and step through the game's generations. ⏯️
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. 📱💻
